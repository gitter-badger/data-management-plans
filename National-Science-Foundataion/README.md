# National Science Foundation 

The NSF has required data management plans (DMPs) since 2011. Each DMP should be less than 2 pages and follow the NSF guidelines published in their [Proposal and Awards Policies and Procedures Guide](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp). However, it is important to be aware that some of the NSF [directorates and divisions have specific DMP guidelines](http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp). Below are a list of directorates and divisions with more specific guidelines.
