# Biological Sciences Directorate DMP Overview 

After reviewing this document, check out our [Biological Sciences Directorate Template](NSF-BIO-Template.md). 

## Requirements
- Supplementary document labeled "Data Management Plan" 
- DMP to be no more than 2 pages
- If no data will be produced, DMP should read "No data are expected to be produced from this project." 
- In collaborative projects, the lead PI is responsibile for the DMP
- The DMP must cover all the types of data collected 
- The lead PI is responsible for reporting in the Annual and Final reports on data management, preservation, and access to the whole project
- DMP should describe with enough detail how data will be managed and shared with enough detail to enable evaluation during the merit review process

## Basic Template 

To help with the review process BIO DMPs should be organized as follows:

1.  Describe the data that will be collected, and the data and metadata formats and standards used

2. Describe what physical and/or cyber resources and facilities (including third party resources) will be used to store and preserve the data after the grant ends. 

3. Describe what media and dissemination methods will be used to make the data and metadata available to others after the grant ends.

4. Describe the policies for data sharing and public access (including provisions for protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property rights and other rights as appropriate)

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of all parties with respect to the management of the data (including contingency plans for the departure of key personnel from the project) after the grant ends.

## Post-award Management

### Annual Reports 

For multi-year awards annual reports must include information about: 
- progress made in data management 
- sharing of research products including 
-- data set identifiers or accession numbers 
-- publication citations
-- conference proceedings
-- any other type of data sharing 

### Final Reports 

Final reports should describe the implementation of the DMP and any changes from the original DMP. Final reports should also contain the following information: 
- The data produced during the award
- The data that will be retained after the award expires 
- How the data will be disseminated and verification that it will be available for sharing 
- The format (including community standards) that will be used to make the data - including any metadata â€“ available to others 
- Where the data generated by the project has been deposited/is being stored for long-term public access 

### Subsequent Proposals 

Data management must be reported in subsequent proposals by PIs and Co-PIs under "Results of prior NSF support."
