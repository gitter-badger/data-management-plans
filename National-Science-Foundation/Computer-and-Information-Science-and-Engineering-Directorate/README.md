## Requirements 

- All proposals must include a data management plan (DMP) and the NSF will not evaluate any proposal that is lacking a DMP
- Even if no research data are going to be produced a DMP is required 
- DMP should be no more than 2 pages
- Must include enough information that reviewers can assess both the current plan and past performance

## Definitions

**Research Data:** "the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, [or] communications with colleagues. This "recorded" material excludes physical objects (e.g., laboratory specimens)."

**Includes 
- metdata
- experimental protocols
- software code written for statistical analysis 


## Basic Template

1. The types of data, metadata, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be collected and/or generated in the course of the project.

2. The standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies).

3. The physical and/or cyber resources and facilities (including those supplied by third parties) that will be used to store and preserve the data after the grant ends.

4. The policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements.

5. The policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives. 

6. The plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them after the award ends.

7. The roles and responsibilities of all parties with respect to the management of the data (including contingency plans for the departure of key personnel from the project) after the grant ends.
